    <ol>
        <li>
            <h2>What is e-waste?</h2>
            <p>E-waste, short for electronic waste, refers to discarded electronic devices like computers, smartphones, and appliances that are no longer in use or have reached the end of their lifespan.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>Why is e-waste management important?</h2>
            <p>E-waste management is crucial due to the hazardous materials present in electronic devices. Proper management prevents environmental pollution, protects human health, and conserves valuable resources.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How should I dispose of my old electronic devices?</h2>
            <p>To dispose of old electronic devices responsibly, consider recycling them through authorized e-waste recycling centers or programs. Avoid disposing of them in regular trash bins or landfill sites.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>What are the environmental impacts of improper e-waste disposal?</h2>
            <p>Improper disposal of e-waste can contaminate soil, water, and air with hazardous substances like lead, mercury, and cadmium. It can also contribute to environmental degradation and harm ecosystems.</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h2>How can I recycle electronic devices?</h2>
